# Release notes

This document chronicles quick-lint-js' releases. This document's format is
based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

quick-lint-js' version numbers are arbitrary. quick-lint-js does *not* adhere to
Semantic Versioning.

## Unreleased

Beta release.

### Changed

* CLI: The `--stdin` option (and `-`) no longer search for configuration files
  in the current working directory. Use the `--path-for-config-search` option to
  approximate the old behavior.
* Emacs: For scratch buffers, the Flycheck and Flymake plugins no longer
  search for configuration files.
* Vim: For unnamed buffers, the ALE plugin no longer searches for configuration
  files in the current working directory's parent and ancestors. Name the buffer
  using the `:file` command if you want a configuration file to take effect.

### Added

* Various new errors (implemented by [Himanshu][])
* CLI: `--path-for-config-search` allows customizing where configuration files
  are found for `--stdin`
* Partially implemented: Global variables can be configured using a
  `quick-lint-js.config` file
* Syntax and schema errors in `quick-lint-js.config` no longer crash
  quick-lint-js. Instead, these errors are highlighted similar to errors in
  JavaScript files.

### Fixed

* Building quick-lint-js with AddressSanitizer on Fedora no longer fails in
  `collect-copyright`
* Building quick-lint-js no longer fails if a directory called `brew` exists
  anywhere in `$PATH`
* Various crashes given invalid JavaScript no longer happen (implemented by
  [wagner riffel][])

## 0.3.0 (2021-07-02)

Beta release.

### Security

* Vim plugin: Version 0.2.0 executed `node_modules/.bin/quick-lint-js` without
  validating that the program is really quick-lint-js. The plugin now
  conservatively ignores `quick-lint-js` in `node_modules` by default.

### Added

* New JS syntax: `.?`, class fields, `import.meta`, top-level `await`,
  `#privateProperties`
* Translations: Swedish (implemented by [Kim "Linden"][])
* Emacs plugin (implemented by [wagner riffel][])
* Neovim plugin
* Errors and warnings are now documented on the website
* Various new errors and error message improvements (implemented by
  [AidenThing][], [Daniel La Rocque][], [Erlliam Mejia][], [Himanshu][], [Lee
  Wannacott][], [Matheus Sousa][])
* Shell completion for the CLI (Bash, Fish, Zsh) (implemented by [Shivam
  Mehta][])
* `--stdin` CLI option allows reading JavaScript from standard input instead of
  a file (implemented by [wagner riffel][])
* Partially implemented: Global variables can be configured using a
  `quick-lint-js.config` file

### Fixed

* Using browser variables such as `document` and `window` no longer reports
  undesired undeclared variable warnings
* `with` statements and `eval` no longer cause spurious undeclared variable
  warnings (implemented by [Himanshu][])
* `++a[0];` no longer reports an assignment-to-const-variable error if `a` was
  declared with `const` (implemented by [Himanshu][])
* `'undefined' === typeof foo ? 3 : 4` no longer reports a warning that `foo` is
  undeclared (implemented by [Himanshu][])
* Building tests with GCC 11.1.1 no longer fails due to `-Werror`
* Various crashes given invalid JavaScript no longer happen
* Building the VS Code plugin now works on Windows (implemented by [Jimmy
  Qiu][])
